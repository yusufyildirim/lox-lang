## Lox Language

This is a Rust implementation of the Lox Programming Language (Java version) from the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. Unlike the original implementation in Java, my implementation doesn't support implicit type conversion, it errors out.

It's good to note that this is my very first Rust project.
